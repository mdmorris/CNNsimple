# CNNsimple
CNN_sparse_classifier.ipynb classifies a simplified model of signal vs. background jets.
training where saved CNN models are stored.
train_data.npz, test_data.npz data currently fed into CNN_sparse_classifier.ipynb.
LRP.ipynb inputs a model and creates heat maps of the relevant input features.
makeJetImages.ipynb makes jet images.
jetImages_bkg.npz, jetImages_signal.npz data to feed into CNN_sparse_classifier in the future.
distribution_generator.ipynb creates dsitributions that jet images are made using.
deprecated holds older versions of CNN's and data making scripts.
